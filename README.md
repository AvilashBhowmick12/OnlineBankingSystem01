This is a prototype and may not have full functionality of a real-world online banking

## Online Banking System
Hello, I’m Avilash Bhowmick, a 3rd-year B.Tech student in Information Technology at Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology.

As part of my “Software Engineering” course, I was assigned a project to develop an “Online Banking System”. I’ve put forth my best efforts to create a functional prototype website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website comprises four main components and three main user roles:

# Components

1. Sign In / Login

* Customer
    - Account
    - Transaction
    - Passbook
      + Passbook Print
    - Loan Application
* Employee
    - Customer Process
    - Loan Sanction
    - Feedback
* Administrator
    - Customer Process
    - Employee Process
    - Feedback
2. Branch Locator

3. More

## Technologies
The website is built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I hope you find this project useful. If you appreciate my work, feel free to connect with me on [https://in.linkedin.com/in/avilash-bhowmick-497b24223]. Thank you!
